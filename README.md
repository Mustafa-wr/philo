# philo-42
philosophers is a programming project at 42 that involves writing a program that simulates the dining philosophers problem. The problem involves a group of philosophers who sit at a table and alternately think and eat using forks. The philosophers project requires you to implement a solution that prevents deadlock and starvation while ensuring that each philosopher gets to eat. It is a relatively long project that tests your understanding of synchronization, concurrency, and threading in C. The philosophers project provides a valuable opportunity to practice implementing complex synchronization algorithms and solving problems related to concurrency in C.
